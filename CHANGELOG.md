In-dev 0.0
    - the start of developing the code for the game

In-dev 0.1
    - adding the game input for player 1

Release 1.0
    The game works on PC!
    - it is untested on the calculator and I will run tests

Hotfix 1.1
    - the code didn't work on the calculator but I removed some unnecessary stuff and hopefully it works now
    - **EDIT** it works but there is no win condition but thats fine and exit() which is what people use to exit the program doesnt work but it still exits the program when the game is done so it still does the same thing the normal exit() would do except theres errors
