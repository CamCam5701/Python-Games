In-dev 0.0
    - The start of developing the code for the game

In-dev 0.1
    - Adding the game input for player 1

Release 1.0
    The game works on PC!
    - it is untested on the calculator and I will run tests

Hotfix 1.0.1
    - The code didn't work on the calculator but I removed some unnecessary stuff and hopefully it works now
    - **EDIT** it works but there is no win condition but thats fine and exit() which is what people use to exit the program doesnt work but it still exits the program when the game is done so it still does the same thing the normal exit() would do except theres errors

Update 1.1
    - Changed the boiard so when no one has claimed a spot is now hashtags, and just improved overall expirience

Hotfox 1.1.1
    - Fixed a bug where you can’t put in inputs, this happened because I changed the board to hashtags but didn’t fix it for the actual player actions

Update 1.2
    - Made the text qrap so its look better on the calculator and made it so the the numbers on the calculator match the grid on the calculator for example, clicking 1 would put the move in the bottom left, same with doing the number 8, it would put it on the top middle
