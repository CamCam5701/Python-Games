In-dev 0.0
    - The start of developing the code for the game

In-dev 0.1
    - Adding the game input for player 1

Release 1.0
    The game works on PC!
    - It is untested on the calculator and I will run tests

Bugfix 1.0.1
    - The code didn't work on the calculator but I removed some unnecessary stuff and hopefully it works now
    - **EDIT** It works but there is no win condition but thats fine and exit() which is what people use to exit the program doesnt work but it still exits the program when the game is done so it still does the same thing the normal exit() would do except theres errors

Update 1.1
    - Changed the board so when no one has claimed a spot it is now hashtags, and just improved overall experience

Bugfix 1.1.1
    - Fixed a bug where you can’t put in inputs, this happened because I changed the board to hashtags but didn’t fix it for the actual player actions

Update 1.2
    - Made the text wrap so it looks better on the calculator and made it so the numbers on the calculator match the grid on the calculator; for example, clicking 1 would put the move in the bottom left, same with doing the number 8, it would put it on the top middle

Update 1.3
    - Added a main menu for the game that includes, a start feature for the game, a tutorial that basically just shows how to input moves on the board on the calculator, and added links to the GitHub repo

Update 1.4
    - Added win conditions so if either player gets 3 in a row the game ends, also added a version number the main menu which just says what game version you are on

Bugfix 1.4.1
    - Fixed a syntax error with the calculator not supporting f-strings

Bugfix 1.4.2
    - Fixed a small bug where if player one wins the code will still ask for player 2's input after you enter an input and maybe fixed some other minor bugs

Bugfix 1.4.3
    - Fixed another small bug that prints the board twice if someone wins

Update 1.4.4
    - Updated the links to match the new GitHub name
