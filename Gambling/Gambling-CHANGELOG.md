The gambling game changelog

Indev 0.0
  - The creation of the gambling game

Release 1.0
  - Added the first gambling game "Coin Toss" which is basically just a 50/50 but is still gambling and I am currently working on the mines game and hopefully soon, other fun games! (there may be bugs for the coin toss game and my be able to predict the outcome if you look through the code or pay attention but it would be hard without looking through the code so if you want an authentic experience just ignore the seeding part)

Bugfix 1.1
    - Fixed a bug where if you run out of money and exit the game it doesnâ€™t actually end it
